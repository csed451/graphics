## Assn3-1 Overview

Assignment 3-1 extends the bullet hell prototype with multiple rendering styles and camera perspectives. The game cycles between wireframe and opaque rendering with `W`, and `C` rotates the camera through top-perspective, top-orthographic, and close third-person views.


## End-User Guide

### 1. Build & Run
Move to the src directory (`graphics/assn3_1/src`) and run one of the provided Makefile commands.

From `./assn3_1/src/`:
- `make` (or `make all`): build the `main` executable into `assn3_1/src/main`.
- `make run`: build (if needed) and launch the game.
- `make clean`: remove `build/` artifacts and `main`.
